// Prerequisites FOR Reactjs

## TODO For Reactjs

0. Learn basics of HTML, CSS, JS
1. Be able to work with Objects & Arrays functions map, filter, reduce & some promises (basically just watch `Namaste JavaScript series` on YouTube)
2. Start Learning React and build something along side
3. Fail and keep learning
4. As you come across a new keyword, concept or you get stuck, just read about it and keep learning alongside.
5. Develop complex features in your app, like Pagination, Multi-Language support, Optimising your app, Complex workflows and keep figuring out how to build all of that.
6. Later as you go ahead, keep diving deep into JavaScript, How web works, How browser works and other tools.

Frontend Projects that will make your Resume STRONGER. üî•

0. Don't make 10 small projects, instead build 1-2 large projects.
   They add much more value to your resume.

1. Build complex features in your large projects like

- Live chat
- API polling
- Debouncing
- Chunking/Lazy Loading
- Multi Language support
- Responsive Interface
- Config-driven UI
- Unit Testing
- SEO optimization
  and more such features..

2. State Management is an important part of your application, make sure you do it well. A lot of interview questions are asked from how you manage data in your application

3. Make sure your project is live on web. No point in making an amazingly awesome project and keeping it just on your localhost.
   Make your project live on a domain name and add the link in your resume, it will just impress the interviewers.

4. Add Test cases - most people think that testing your project is optional.
   NO, it's not. Add test cases and mention that in your resume. It is very underrated skill and will definitely impress the interviewers making your resume stronger.

Lastly, 5. Please DON'T copy others' project and add in your resume. üôè
Interviewers are smart enough to catch you.
